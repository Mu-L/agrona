== Unreleased

* **[Breaking]** Removed `org.agrona.concurrent.SigInt`. Use
`org.agrona.concurrent.ShutdownSignalBarrier` instead.

== https://github.com/aeron-io/agrona/releases/tag/2.3.0[2.3.0] - 2025-09-29

* **[Breaking]** Changed `org.agrona.concurrent.ShutdownSignalBarrier` to use shutdown hooks instead of signals.
+
Previously `ShutdownSignalBarrier` relied on intercepting `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`
 https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html[OS signals] by overriding JVM's signal handling which was
 preventing shutdown hooks from be executed. This in turn was breaking applications and frameworks that relied on
 shutdown hooks for clean termination.
+
New implementation uses shutdown hooks instead and requires `ShutdownSignalBarrier` to be explicitly closed.
+
_**NB: Failure to close `ShutdownSignalBarrier` might result in JVM not terminating!**_
+
As the result the code using `ShutdownSignalBarrier` needs to be updated:
+
- Old:
+
[source,java]
----
class UsageSample
{
    public static void main(final String[] args) 
    {
        try (MyService service = new MyService())
        {
            new ShutdownSignalBarrier().await();
        }
    }
}
----
+
- New:
+
[source,java]
----
class UsageSample
{ 
    public static void main(final String[] args) 
    {
        try (ShutdownSignalBarrier barrier = new ShutdownSignalBarrier();
             MyService service = new MyService())
        {
            barrier.await();
        }
    }
}
----
+
In the above example `ShutdownSignalBarrier` is closed last to ensure that `service` terminates completely before
`ShutdownSignalBarrier` closes which in turn allows JVM to exit.

* **[Breaking]** Deprecated `org.agrona.concurrent.SigInt` for removal. Use
`org.agrona.concurrent.ShutdownSignalBarrier` instead.
+
_**NB:** `org.agrona.concurrent.SigInt.register(java.lang.Runnable)` is unsafe as it overrides `SIGINT` signal
 handling of the JVM thus preventing shutdown hooks from being executed._
+
An example using `ShutdownSignalBarrier` instead of `SigInt`:

- Old:

class FlagSample
{
    public static void main(final String[] args)
    {
        final AtomicBoolean running = new AtomicBoolean(false);
        SigInt.register(() -> running.set(false));
        while(running.get())
        {
            ...
        }
    }
}

    {
        final AtomicBoolean running = new AtomicBoolean(true);
        try (ShutdownSignalBarrier barrier = new ShutdownSignalBarrier(() -> running.set(false))
        {
            while (running.get())
            {
                ...
            }
        }
    }
